## Opening Dev Container:
  -  run the command `git clone -b no-merge/devcontainer https://github.com/Accommodus/NearestTransit.git` in the terminal
  -  Verify the Dev Containers extension installed on VS code. 
  -  open the cloned repository folder in VS code. VS code should automatically detect the .devcontainer folder and prompt you to reopen in a Dev Container.
  -  If not prompted by VS code, open the Command Palette `Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P on macOS` and search for and select `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container`

---

The container workspace will automatically open to the main branch of this repo.
